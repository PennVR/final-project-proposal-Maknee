Proposal 1

There are plenty of mech games out there. However, the games do not exactly simulate the piloting of a robot because there was a lack of three dimension depth or engaging control systems. Incorporating VR into a mech game would perfect the experience and controls of the game. A HTC Vive set would give a user an ability of perceive depth in the game and have control of a mech. The headset would correspond to a player's head in the mech suit and the controllers would correspond to the hands of the user that can adjust buttons, switchs and gears in the robot. The game would include a short tutorial to give new users a feel for the game and a multiplayer option to battle with other people in VR.

Proposal 2

A game that incorporates elements from Valve's Portal game series and Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed series would make an interesting puzzle game to play. The parkour aspect from Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed would bring a variety of ways to approach solving a puzzle along with using portal guns. The experience would be even better than with using the keyboard and mouse. Users would be able to pick up objects and figure out a way to solve the puzzle in the room. Movement and parkouring may be difficult to implement, but the idea of destination points could be used in combination with the user actually acting the movement out would possibly work. The user may get motion sickness from the game by moving through the portals, but that could be limited by having portals only exist on the x/z axes.

Proposal 3

Incorporating VR into hack and slash adventure games like The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or Nier: Automata would bring a number of possibilities to improve the gameplay and experience. Dodging projectiles would not be chunky and awkward. The user satasification of blocking or reflecting an attack would drastically improve. Some of the movement with weird or uncomfortable camera and movement could go away by including VR. For example, shooting a projectile with a controller is extremely awkward because the user has to keep adjusting the x coordinates and then the y coordinates until the user was sure that he/she is aimed at the target. With VR, the camera movement and controller movement would feel more natural. However, movement in a game is restricted again by the fixed bounding boxes of a room. A possibilty of fixing the movement would be to detect a set of motions with the controllers that would indicate that the user is running.
