Proposal #1
There are plenty of mech games out there. However, the games do not exactly simulate the piloting of a robot because there was a lack of three dimension depth or engaging control systems. Incorporating VR into a mech game would perfect the experience and controls of the game. A HTC Vive set would give a user an ability of perceive depth in the game and have control of a mech. The headset would correspond to a player's head in the mech suit and the controllers would correspond to the hands of the user that can adjust buttons, switchs and gears in the robot. The game would include a short tutorial to give new users a feel for the game and a multiplayer option to battle with other people in VR.
