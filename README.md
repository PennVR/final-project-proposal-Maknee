Proposal 1

There are plenty of mech games out there. However, the games do not exactly simulate the piloting of a robot because there was a lack of three dimension depth or engaging control systems. Incorporating VR into a mech game would perfect the experience and controls of the game. A HTC Vive set would give a user an ability of perceive depth in the game and have control of a mech. The headset would correspond to a player's head in the mech suit and the controllers would correspond to the hands of the user that can adjust buttons, switchs and gears in the robot. The game would include a short tutorial to give new users a feel for the game and a multiplayer option to battle with other people in VR.

Proposal 2

A game that incorporates elements from Valve's Portal game series and Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed series would make an interesting puzzle game to play. The parkour aspect from Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed would bring a variety of ways to approach solving a puzzle along with using portal guns. The experience would be even better than with using the keyboard and mouse. Users would be able to pick up objects and figure out a way to solve the puzzle in the room. Movement and parkouring may be difficult to implement, but the idea of destination points could be used in combination with the user actually acting the movement out would possibly work. The user may get motion sickness from the game by moving through the portals, but that could be limited by having portals only exist on the x/z axes.
